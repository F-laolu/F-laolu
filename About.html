		<p>My name is OLAOLUWA FOLORUNSHO, I am a 1st year Computer Science Student of Nottingham Trent University. In this section, i will be reflecting and telling you about how activities outside my course has helped me. <br><br> My experience with the activities done with the CPD hours has expanded my knowledge in various apects which i have broken into five (5) parts namely: <br><br>- Developing a wide knowledge in other areas not just limited to my course. This can be found in the <a href="Education.html">Education page.</a> <br>- Gain insights in career paths which is demonstrated in the <a href="Societies.html">Societies page</a>. <br>- Develop my knowledge of computing which is also demonstrated in the <a href="Societies.html">Societies page</a>. <br>- Socialise and develop with like minded students this is shown in the <a href="PeerSupport.html">Peer Support page</a>. <br>- Develop my leadership ability which is demonstrated in the <a href="Societies.html">Societies page</a>. <br><br> In general, i was able to spend 31-hours on these activities for my Continuing Professional Development (CPD) which has also helped me with settling down in the university. <br><br>Also, taking up a leadership role has increased my leadership abilities and enhanced my communication skills as i have to listen to what my colleagues have to say and suggest improvements.</p>
